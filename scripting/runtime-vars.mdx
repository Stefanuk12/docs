title: Runtime Variables
---

Luarmor has runtime variables that allows you to access to user details such as Discord ID, total executions, script name, premium, user note, etc..

<Warning>
    Luarmor does not protect these runtime variables and they can be hooked and modified maliciously. Make sure to add your own protections, if needed.
</Warning>

They can be used for a lot of things. Check out this example:
<Frame caption="An example script using runtime variables">
    <img src="/images/runtime-vars-example.png" alt="An example script using runtime variables" />
</Frame>
