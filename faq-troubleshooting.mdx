When using Luarmor, you may come across some errors or issues. This page will help you troubleshoot and solve common problems. If your issue is not listed here, please contact our support team.

## Uploading scripts

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Luau is not fully supported">
        Luraph, and therefore, Luarmor does not fully support Luau. Therefore, you must remove some Luau features from your script before uploading it to Luarmor. This includes:
        - any types
        - inline ternary via `if` statement:
        ```lua
        -- this does not work
        local maxValue = if value > 10 then 10 else value end

        -- instead, use:
        local maxValue
        if value > 10 then
            maxValue = 10
        else
            maxValue = value
        end
        ```
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Running scripts

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Your script isn't working">
        To test whether it's an issue on your end or Luarmor's, make sure "Silent Mode" is disabled in the script settings. If you see that Luarmor has successfully authenticated in F9 console, then the issue is 100% with your script. If you see a Luarmor error, please refer to these docs or ask for support, if your issue is not here.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="attempt to index thread with 'Send'">
        This happens due to a bad websocket implementation within the exploit that is being used. To fix this, either:
        - use a different executor
        - ask the script owner to disable the "Heartbeat" feature in their script
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## Discord bot

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="This bot can't join more servers">
        We are likely aware of this issue. Please wait for us to upload a new bot which you can use.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Failed to compensate">
        This error happens when one of the keys has an expiration that may overflow the 32-bit integer limit. Essentially, make sure every key has an expiration before 2038. If you want a key to last forever (lifetime), then do not set an expiration date.
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## Verification

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Rejection">
        If your script got rejected, it is becuase it did not meet the [rules and limitations](./scripting/verification#rules-and-limitations). Please either:
        - fix the issues and resubmit
        - disable `Verification` for the script
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Miscellaneous

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Help, I've been scammed!">
        <Warning>
            Failure to provide enough proof will result in your ticket being closed without any further investigation, and possibly a ban. It's **very** important that you provide as much information as possible when opening the ticket, instead of us having to ask you for it.
        </Warning>

        Unfortunately, our support staff cannot help you with this and it's very unlikely we will be able to investigate much. However, if you open a ticket and provide **FULL** details, then we may be able to help you. Please provide:
        - the scammer's username
        - the scammer's Discord server
        - proof of purchase
        - proof of denial of service
        - and any other relevant information that can strengthen your case
