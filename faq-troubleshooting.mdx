When using Luarmor, you may come across some errors or issues. This page will help you troubleshoot and solve common problems. If your issue is not listed here, please contact our support team.

## Uploading scripts

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Luau is not fully supported">
        While Luraph supports Luau fully, Luarmor does not. Therefore, you must remove some Luau features from your script before uploading it to Luarmor. This includes:
        - any types
        - inline ternary via `if` statement:
        ```lua
        -- this does not work
        local maxValue = if value > 10 then 10 else value end

        -- instead, use:
        local maxValue
        if value > 10 then
            maxValue = 10
        else
            maxValue = value
        end
        ```

        For more information, view the Luau docs [here](https://luau-lang.org/syntax).

        <Accordion title="Automatically support via darklua">
            <Steps>
                <Step title="Go to the playground">
                    A web version of darklua can be accessed [here](https://darklua.com/try-it/?configuration=%7B%22rules%22%3A%5B%22remove_comments%22%2C%22remove_interpolated_string%22%2C%22remove_types%22%2C%22remove_compound_assignment%22%5D%7D).
                </Step>
                <Step title="Paste your code">
                    Paste your code into the left box.
                </Step>
                <Step title="Press the format button">
                    To ensure everything worked, press the "Configure" button, then press the "format" button on the left panel
                </Step>
                <Step title="Copy the code">
                    <Note>
                        Press `CTRL + A` to select all, then `CTRL + C` to copy, instead of manually selecting the code.
                    </Note>

                    Copy the code from the right box and paste it into Luarmor.
                </Step>
            </Steps>
        </Accordion>
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="The line count isn't making sense / matching up">
        Luarmor adds its own code before obfuscation which changes the line count. Therefore the line count is not accurate and unreliable.
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Running scripts

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Your script isn't working">
        To test whether it's an issue on your end or Luarmor's, make sure "Silent Mode" is disabled in the script settings. If you see that Luarmor has successfully authenticated in F9 console, then the issue is 100% with your script. If you see a Luarmor error, please refer to these docs or ask for support, if your issue is not here.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="My script keeps crashing">
        This is 100% an issue with your script. However, [script optimisations](./scripting/optimisation.mdx) may help.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="attempt to index thread with 'Send'">
        This happens due to a bad websocket implementation within the exploit that is being used. To fix this, either:
        - use a different executor
        - ask the script owner to disable the "Heartbeat" feature in their script
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="My modules don't work with Luarmor">
        Luarmor does not return the main function. This means returning anything at the end of the script is not supported. To fix this, you need to assign your module to a global variable.
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## Discord bot

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="This bot can't join more servers">
        Ensure that you have tried ALL of the available bots listed [here](https://luarmor.net/bot). If none are addable, please wait for us to upload a new bot which you can use.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Failed to compensate">
        This error happens when one of the keys has an expiration that may overflow the 32-bit integer limit. Essentially, make sure every key has an expiration before 2038. If you want a key to last forever (lifetime), then do not set an expiration date.
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## Verification

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Rejection">
        If your script got rejected, it is becuase it did not meet the [rules and limitations](./scripting/verification#rules-and-limitations). Please either:
        - fix the issues and resubmit
        - disable `Verification` for the script
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Miscellaneous

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Help, I've been scammed!">
        <Warning>
            Failure to provide enough proof will result in your ticket being closed without any further investigation, and possibly a ban. It's **very** important that you provide as much information as possible when opening the ticket, instead of us having to ask you for it.
        </Warning>

        Unfortunately, our support staff cannot help you with this and it's very unlikely we will be able to investigate much. However, if you open a ticket and provide **FULL** details, then we may be able to help you. Please provide:
        - the scammer's username
        - the scammer's Discord server
        - proof of purchase
        - proof of denial of service
        - and any other relevant information that can strengthen your case
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="I've found a way to detect Luarmor">
        Before you get too excited, please enable "Silent Mode" in the script and check whether the detection still works. If it does, then please report it to us and let us know that you have silent mode enabled.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="I've purchased with Patreon, what now?">
        <Steps>
            <Step title="Link Discord to Patreon">
                To get your `User` rule, you must link your Discord to Patreon. If you are unsure how to do this, please refer to [this guide](https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/212052266-Getting-Discord-access) by Patreon.
            </Step>
            <Step title="Screenshot your Patreon membership">
                Take a screenshot of the Luarmor membership section on Patreon. This should show what level of pledge you have. For example, it could say one of the following:
                - Luarmor Basic ($15)
                - Luarmor Premium ($25)
                - Luarmor Pro ($40)
            </Step>
            <Step title="Screenshot your proof of purchase">
                This can be as simple as sending a screenshot of the payment receipt from PayPal.
            </Step>
            <Step title="Open a ticket">
                Open a ticket in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/luarmor) and provide all of the information gathered in previous steps. Make sure you have the `Subscribed via Patreon` role before making a ticket. Here is a rough guide you can use, replace the placeholders (stuff inside `[]`) with your information:

                ```
