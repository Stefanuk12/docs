## Introduction

Luarmor also has a Discord bot ready for you to invite to your server. The bot allows you to manage your script, whitelist users, and more. It also allows users to manage their key.

## Inviting the bot

<Warning>
    After inviting the bot, you must run `/login [API KEY]` within the first 15 minutes, otherwise bot will automatically leave the server.

    </Frame>
</Warning>

You can view all of the discord bot invite links [here](https://luarmor.net/bot), each one is identical. The reason for having many bots is because Discord limits the amount of servers a bot can be in.

## Setting up permissions

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Manager role">
        People with manager role can run basic management command like [/whitelist](#whitelist) and [/force-resethwid](#force-resethwid). This role will be used in the next section.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Buyer role">
        <Note>
            This is optional.
        </Note>

        This role is automatically assigned to users when:
        - a manager whitelists them
        - user redeems a key via the [panel](#create-a-panel)
        - user gets their role via the [panel](#create-a-panel)

        It gives them access to the script via the [panel](#create-a-panel) and the ability to reset their HWID. This role may be used in the next section.
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Create a panel

<Warning>
    You can only have one panel / one loader script per server.
</Warning>

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Creating the loader script">
        <Warning>
            Do not make your loader script too long. Discord has a limit on the size of files that can be sent. An alternative is to redirect your users to a `#script` channel where you can upload the entire script manually and make the `loader_script` point to that channel.
        </Warning>

        This is the script users will recieve when they press "Get Script" on the panel, which will be configured in the next step.

        <Frame caption="An example loader script">

        </Frame>
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Creating the panel">
        The panel creation is all handled through the `/setpanel` command which creates a new panel in the current channel. It must be given a `loader_script` and a `manager_role`, but optionally can also be given a `buyer_role`.

            <img src="/images/example-panel.png" alt="An image showing the panel in Discord" />
        </Frame>
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Whitelisting users

<Note>
    If `days` is not specified, then the user will be whitelisted indefinitely.
</Note>

Users can be whitelisted and unwhitelisted through the `/whitelist` and `/unwhitelist` commands by [managers](#manager-role).

<Accordion title="Mass whitelist">
    If you already have users with a specific role, you can easily mass whitelist every single one of them with one command. This is done through the `/mass-whitelist` command, which asks for the `role` and, optionally, the number of `days`.

    <Warning>
        `Total failed` means their discord IDs are already registered, so in order to avoid duplicated entries, it will skip them.
    </Warning>

    <CardGroup cols={3}>

            <img src="/images/discord-user-list.png" alt="An image showing the list of users in Discord" />

## Luarmor logs

You can setup logs via [Discord webhooks](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks). This is done through the `/setlogs` command. This will log all Discord Luarmor command and button usage.

## Manager commands

All of the following commands can only be ran by people with the [manager role](#manager-role).

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="/blacklist">
        <Note>
            If `days` is not provided, then the user will be blacklisted indefinitely.
        </Note>

        This command blacklists a specific Discord user from the project. You can optionally give a reason to show to the user and the amount of days.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="/compensate">
        This command add a specified amount of days to everyone's keys in the project. Example usage of this command may be when your script was patched and you want to compensate your users.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="/force-resethwid">
        <Note>
            This ignores any cooldowns you have set.
